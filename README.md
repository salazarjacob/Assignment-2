# Assignment-2
There are a lot of biases to test for in the Perspective API, like gender bias, language bias, etc. I have decided to test the Perspective API for bias in its labeling of scores. Specifically, if higher or lower scores will lead to more or less labels, respectively. Since the scores attributed to a comment represent how “toxic” it may be perceived my someone, I have chosen threshold of ≥0.55 to represent an objectively “high” score, and a threshold of ≤0.54 to represent an objectively “low” score. I have also decided to examine all labels in my analysis. The whole point of the analysis is to see whether certain scores garner a certain number of labels, so it is essential that all labels be included in the analysis. Excluding any label will skew results and will not misrepresent the Perspective API’s performance ability.
# Hypothesis
Comments with a “high” score will be attributed with more labels, and comments with a “low” score will be attributed to less labels.
